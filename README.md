### Description

This course is aimed towards those who are new to JavaScript development and while you may not have mastered JavaScript you want to learn more about using the React library. React has a steep learning curve for new developers. If you have found yourself quickly overwhelmed by the React Docs or other React tutorials then this is the course for you. This isn't the only React course you should take but it should be your first.

- This course will focus on the basic fundamentals that could be of great help in future React courses you might take or understanding the React Docs.

- Through lots of challenges and repetition you will be able to take everything we learn and build with it ('real world' application and implementation). 

- I will filter through and synthesize large and complex React concepts and break them down to a practical level.

- We will build slow, focusing on understanding of key concepts, and form a strong foundation of React fundamentals.
